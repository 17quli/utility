--Sample code to execute in Hue to verify the results of the P1 Data Fix

--after the data fix the only value for min_record_effective_timestamp_per_key should be '1800-01-01 00:00:00'   
select distinct t.min_record_effective_timestamp_per_key from

order by t.min_record_effective_timestamp_per_key 

--check that there is only one record per each Natural Key where record_effective_timestamp = '1800-01-01 00:00:00' - the output should be just one observation with value 1
